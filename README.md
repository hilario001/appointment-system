# Appointment-System

A school project that will be using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP as the languages and MYSQL
as the database.

This system allows the admin/service-providers to manage their services and
appointments booked by customers in the same platform such as view and confirm
upcoming appointments, have a CRUD frontend for the services offered and set the
available schedule, etc.
